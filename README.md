installation
==============

    wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kakulukia/dotfiles/master/misc/setup.sh | bash

disclaimer
===========

This theme was inspired by PowerlinePlain (https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it/blob/master/themes/powerline-plain/powerline-plain.theme.bash) and based on BulletTrain (https://github.com/caiogondim/bullet-train-oh-my-zsh-theme).

In the misc folder you can find the Powerline patched SourceCode font and my currently used Sundried.itermcolors.

          Well, the shell recording won't fit on your screen, so you should at least
          enable desktop mode. But even then phones are kinda small. :/

        h2.subtitle Intro
        p.
          For the last 5 years I have been building up my shell environment and its the
          first thing that gets installed on a new server or Mac. Especially fasd and the reverse
          history search is a huge time saver.
        p.
          Some of this stuff I didn't even know was possible before I switched to ZSH or
          found app X, so i just wanted to share the whole collection.

        h2.subtitle Installation
        p.
          Be sure you are logged in as the user for whom you want to install this shell
          package and that the user has sudo rights.
        .install
          img(src="install_dotfiles.png")
          p
            span.command curl
            span.text  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kakulukia/dotfiles/master/misc/setup.sh"
            span  |
            span.command  sh
        p.
          This will install the following:
        ul
          li GIT to be able to download the repo itself
          li ZSH as your new default shell
          li Python3
          li oh my zsh
          li ghar for managing the dotfiles itself (links everything into your home folder)
          li SpaceVim
          li fasd
          li some handy aliases

        p.
          #[strong Note:] Use the #[span.command ~/.gitconfig-personal] file to set your git username.
          That file is imported in #[span.command .gitconfig] so that settings can be ported via this
          repo, but the username stays personal.

        p In the misc folder you can find:
        ul
          li the Powerline patched SourceCode font (you may use any #[a(href="https://www.nerdfonts.com/") Nerdfont])
          li my currently used Sundried.itermcolors
          li better-osx-settings script
          li.
            an opinionated set of tools (#[a(href="https://github.com/kakulukia/dotfiles/blob/master/misc/essentials.txt") these] and
            #[a(href="https://github.com/kakulukia/dotfiles/blob/master/misc/additional-stuff.sh") those])

        p The dotfiles repo can be updated with the #[span.command update-dotfiles] alias.

        h2.subtitle Features
        p Apart from what's shown in the recording, here is some more of what's included:
        ul
          li suggestions (grey text) - use the right arrow key to accept
          li history reverse search - use the up arrow to cycle through previous commands.
            |  Anything you typed before hitting up will be used as filter and highlighted.
            |  This seriously saves a lot of typing. ðŸ˜‡

            figure
              img(src="history.png")
              figcaption migr + up
          li red / green colored commands - shows that the command is (un)available
          li . is in the path so no need for any ./ prefixing executables
          li path
            ul
              li print a sorted version of $PATH
              li add the given folder to $PATH and
              li append the given path to your .profile when called with #[span.command path --save DIR]
          li mv - no need to type the file name twice for renaming
          li top - is aliased to glances if installed
          li ctop - for docker containers
          li ,, - jump to the git root dir
          li o - will open the finder in the current directory
          li cd to.app - the is an app in the bin folder that provides a
            |  way to reverse the trick an open a terminal at the current finder location.
            |  Use the command key to just drag it into the finders toolbar.
            br
            br
            figure
              img(src="cdto.png")
              figcaption The result will look like this
          li tm - there's a tmux theme and tm will reconnect to to your last session or create a new one
            br
            | I also changed the default prefix to CTRL+SPACE for easier usage.
          li diff - aliased to diff-so-fancy in general, not just the git version
          li co - use fasd to launch any known file in VS Code
          li errorcode - in general I don't see the point in displaying the error code
            | , hence the sad smiley in the prompt, but if you really wanna know, use that alias (unless you can remember the #?)
          li ips - will show all local ips (IPV4) / ip will show some info about your external one
          li ping - is aliased to prettyping if installed
          li go-reload - hot reload for go apps you are working on
          li mgs - multi git status - if your company/current project totally embraces micro services (ðŸ™ˆ)
            |  this might come in handy to update em all in one go
          li rg - alias for "rg -S --max-columns 444" won't clutter the screen with nasty one line files


        h2.subtitle ToDo
        ul
          li colorls is a lil slow - there is a promising alternative, but
            a(hreaf="https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd/issues/92")  it's not looking sexy yet
          li Maybe some day in the future I'm switching yet again to prezto and will redo my default theme.
            |  But as of yet this still sounds like too much trouble. :/
